# Resume-Relevancy-Enhancement-Tool
The Resume Relevancy Enhancement Tool aims to streamline the job application process by evaluating the alignment between a user's resume and a specified job description. Upon entering the job description and uploading their resume in PDF format, the tool utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to assess the relevancy of the resume content to the job requirements.

The core functionality involves analyzing key elements such as skills, experience, and qualifications mentioned in both the job description and the resume. A relevancy percentage is then calculated based on how closely the resume matches the job description. If the relevancy percentage falls below 50%, indicating a significant mismatch, the tool generates suggestions for enhancing the resume to better fit the job profile. This includes identifying missing skills or experience that could improve the candidate's suitability.

Currently in the development stage, the tool's backend is being refined to enhance accuracy and efficiency in evaluating resume relevancy. Future iterations will focus on improving the user interface and experience, making it more intuitive and user-friendly. Ultimately, the Resume Relevancy Enhancement Tool aims to empower job seekers by helping them tailor their resumes effectively to specific job opportunities, thereby increasing their chances of securing interviews and employment.
